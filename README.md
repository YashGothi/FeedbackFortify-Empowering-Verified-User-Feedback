# FeedbackFortify-Empowering-Verified-User-Feedback

## Overview

The FeedbackFortify project is a web application designed to handle user inquiries securely by verifying their phone number through an OTP (One-Time Password) system. The application uses Firebase for backend services, including authentication and database storage. Users can submit their name, query, and phone number, after which they receive an OTP to verify their identity. Once verified, their inquiry is saved to the Firebase Realtime Database, and they are notified that they will be contacted within a specified time frame.

## Main Features

User Inquiry Submission: Users can submit their name, query, and phone number through a form.
OTP Verification: The application sends an OTP to the user's phone number to verify their identity.
Firebase Realtime Database: Verified inquiries are saved to the Firebase Realtime Database.
User Notification: Users are alerted to the status of their inquiry submission and OTP verification.

## EnApp.js

The EnApp.js file is the main component of the application. It includes form inputs for the user's name, query, and phone number. It also handles the OTP sending and verification process using Firebase Authentication. After successful verification, the user's inquiry is saved to the Firebase Realtime Database, and they are alerted that they will be contacted shortly.
